   - Extract the column names from each CSV file.
   - Determine the appropriate data types for each column.

5. **Table Creation and Data Insertion:**
   - Within pgAdmin 4, create tables named after each corresponding CSV file.
   - Insert the data from the CSV files into their respective tables within the "ecommerce" database. Refer to the "Loading CSV Files" section for the SQL queries used for this process.

**B. Data Cleaning, Transformation, and Analysis**

1. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:**
   - Cleanse and transform the data according to the following guidelines:
     - Remove irrelevant data.
     - Eliminate duplicate records.
     - Rectify structural errors.
     - Perform data type conversions where necessary.
     - Address missing data.
     - Handle outliers that may skew the analysis.

2. **Data Analysis:**
   - Begin analyzing the cleaned and transformed data.
   - Explore the datasets to uncover relationships, patterns, and insights that can inform decision-making and business strategies.

This structured data processing workflow ensures that we start with well-organized data in a PostgreSQL database, apply necessary data cleaning and transformation steps, and culminate in an analysis phase where we extract valuable insights from the data.
