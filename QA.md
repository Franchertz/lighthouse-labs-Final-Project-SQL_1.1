What are your risk areas? Identify and describe them.

**Key Risk Areas**

1. **Data Bias:** There is a potential risk of bias within the dataset, which may result in unjust or discriminatory outcomes during the analysis and subsequent decision-making processes.

2. **Data Quality:** Ensuring the dataset's accuracy, completeness, and consistency is paramount. The quality of the data directly impacts the reliability of analyses and the validity of conclusions drawn from it.

3. **Privacy and Security:** Safeguarding sensitive or personally identifiable information contained within the dataset is a critical concern. Upholding data privacy and security measures is imperative to mitigate the risk of privacy breaches.

4. **Data Incompleteness:** Addressing missing or incomplete data is of utmost importance. Neglecting to handle these gaps may introduce biases or inaccuracies into the analysis, compromising the quality of insights derived from the dataset.

5. **Interpretation Bias:** Maintaining objectivity in data interpretation and analysis is essential. Bias-free analysis is vital to ensure that the insights drawn from the dataset remain impartial and free from preconceived notions or unintended biases.


QA Process:
Describe your QA process and include the SQL queries used to execute it.

# QA Process:
## Describe your QA process and include the SQL queries used to execute it.
### 1) Data Quality Check:
Process: Verify that the dataset is clean, consistent, and free from errors.
-- Test Case: Check for missing values in the "totaltransactionrevenue" column
```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*) AS missing_revenue_count
FROM all_seasions
WHERE totaltransactionrevenue IS NULL;
```

### 2) Data Completeness: 
Process: Ensure that all relevant data is present in the dataset.
-- Test Case: Check if all required columns have non-null values
```SQL
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS total_records,
  COUNT(*) - COUNT(city) AS missing_city_count,
  COUNT(*) - COUNT(country) AS missing_country_count,
  COUNT(*) - COUNT(totaltransactionrevenue) AS missing_revenue_count
FROM all_seasions;
```

### 3) Data Validation: 
Process: Verify the correctness of data and data relationships.
-- Test Case: Check if the sum of individual product revenues matches the total transaction revenue for each transaction
```SQL
SELECT 
  transactionid,
  SUM(productrevenue) AS total_product_revenue,
  totaltransactionrevenue,
  CASE 
    WHEN ROUND(SUM(productrevenue), 2) = ROUND(totaltransactionrevenue, 2) THEN 'Match'
    ELSE 'Mismatch'
  END AS validation_result
FROM all_seasions
WHERE transactionid IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY transactionid, totaltransactionrevenue;
```

### In the above examples, the queries are used to perform Quality Assurance: quality check, data completeness, and data validation processes. 
The test cases are designed to check specific aspects of the dataset, such as missing values, correctness of data relationships, and consistency of data. The results obtained from these queries will help identify any data issues and validate the accuracy and completeness of the dataset.
